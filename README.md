# Fusion 360 Learning Repository

Welcome to the **Fusion 360 Learning Repository!** This is a collaborative space where we document our journey in learning **Fusion 360** for mechanical design, rendering, and 3D modeling. They are using the free personal use license.

## About This Repository

This repository follows the learning path of **Alex and Ivy** as they develop their skills in **Fusion 360**. The primary focus includes:

- **Mechanical Design**
- **Rendering**
- **Creating Manufacturable 3D Models**

## Study Plan

Our learning is structured into a **5-week work plan**, organized in the [F360 Study Plan](#) file. This structured approach starts with **beginner-friendly** designs, progresses to **intermediate concepts**, and eventually covers **manufacturable designs**.

### Individual Progress

Both Alex and Ivy document their learning progress in separate files:

- **Ivy's Progress:** [IvysProg](#)
- **Alex's Progress:** [AlexProg](#)

These files showcase their growth from beginners to proficient designers in Fusion 360.
